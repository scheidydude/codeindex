# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.3.6] - 2026-06-07

### Added

- **`blastradius symbol-blast <file>`** — per-export blast radius for a file. Lists every
  exported symbol with a count and list of which importer files reference it by name.
  Answers "which routes use each export from lib/db/schema.ts" without manual grep.
  Supports `--json` for programmatic use.

### Fixed

- **`[renders]` edge label on non-component files** — `_JSX_PASCAL_RE` matched TypeScript
  generics like `Promise<Response>` or `Map<Key, Val>`, causing `.ts` files with generics
  to be classified as "component", then `link_kind("component","component")` returned
  "renders". Added `(?<!\w)` negative lookbehind so generics (preceded by a word char)
  are excluded.
- **`lookup` not-found hint** — when a symbol isn't in the index, output now notes that
  only repo-defined symbols are indexed (third-party imports like NextAuth are not).

## [0.3.5] - 2026-06-07

### Fixed

- **Search result ranking** — `hybrid_search` now applies a post-RRF boost (1.5×) to
  symbols whose file path contains a query stem, and a secondary boost (1.2×) for
  exported symbols. `auth.ts` now outranks `feedback/route.ts` when searching
  "authentication", even if both contain auth-related symbols.
- **FTS query reduction** — `fts_search` dropped from 3 SQLite round-trips to 2 max
  (primary prefix-OR, then truncation fallback). Removed the exact-phrase last-resort
  pass which added latency without meaningfully improving recall. Truncation logic
  simplified to 3/4 and 4-char floor (removed 1/2 variant that added noise).

## [0.3.4] - 2026-06-07

### Fixed

- **`lookup` shows code snippet** — plain-mode output now prints 5 lines of source context
  around the definition (with `>` marker on the definition line), making `lookup` useful
  without needing to open the file separately.

## [0.3.3] - 2026-06-07

### Fixed

- **`lookup` reads SQLite DB** — `blastradius lookup` and the `lookup_symbol` MCP tool
  previously read `symbolindex.json`, which is only written by `blastradius symbols`.
  Both now query `Store.lookup_by_name()` from the SQLite DB (the same source as
  `blastradius search`), falling back to `symbolindex.json` only when no DB is present.
  Symbols found via search — including those extracted from destructured re-exports —
  are now consistently reachable via lookup.
- **`lookup` output shows symbol name** — plain-mode output was `auth.ts:8 (const)`;
  now `auth.ts:8 signIn (const)`, matching the format search results use.
- **Porter stemmer FTS5 tokenizer** — `symbols_fts` is rebuilt with
  `tokenize="porter unicode61"` (schema v3) so `authentication` matches `authenticate`
  and vice versa. Schema migration drops and recreates the FTS table automatically.
- **Progressive prefix truncation in `fts_search`** — fallback query tries 3/4, 1/2,
  and 4-character floor prefix variants so short tokens like `auth` match longer
  compound forms (`authenticate`, `authorization`). FTS5 special characters are
  sanitized before query construction.
- **Destructured re-export extraction** — `export const { signIn, signOut } = NextAuth(config)`
  and `export { foo, bar as baz }` patterns are now extracted as individual named symbols.
  Previously these produced no indexed symbols, making them invisible to search and lookup.
- **`high-blast` shows LOC** — plain output and JSON/MCP response now include line count,
  making thin wrappers (high blast score, low LOC) immediately distinguishable from
  genuine API surfaces with broad real coupling.
- **`changed-since` edge origin annotation** — added edges now carry `first_seen_commit`;
  when N edges share the `last_indexed_commit` value, the CLI prints a count. The message
  branches on whether `blastradius history` has been run:
  - History not run: `"run blastradius history to date them accurately"`
  - History run: `"bootstrap-gap artifacts: existed before the first blastradius analyze
    and cannot be dated further"` — correctly reflects the inherent limitation rather
    than implying a fixable error. MCP response gains `bootstrap_gap` boolean.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-06-07

### Fixed

- **TypeScript path alias resolution** — imports using `@/*`, `~/`, or any
  alias defined in `tsconfig.json` / `jsconfig.json` `compilerOptions.paths`
  were silently treated as external packages. All reverse-dependency counts,
  blast scores, and `imported_by` lists were therefore zero for every real
  source file in TypeScript repos. The JS analyzer now reads path aliases and
  resolves them to actual file paths before falling back to the external-package
  path.
- **History backfill `first_seen_commit` overwrites** — `apply_file_temporal`
  and `apply_edge_temporal` guarded updates with `WHERE first_seen_commit IS
  NULL`. Because `analyze()` always writes the current HEAD commit as
  `first_seen_commit` on insert, the NULL guard silently suppressed every
  history update. Both methods now unconditionally overwrite with the
  historically-derived value. `apply_edge_temporal` also drops the `kind=`
  filter so `renders`/`styles`/`depends` edges are updated alongside `imports`
  edges.
- **`changed-since` modified files** — output now includes a `Modified files`
  section (files with content changes but no structural add/remove) derived
  from `git diff --name-status`. Added `git_modified()` to `index.py`.
- **`changed-since` edge noise** — added/removed edges are now filtered to
  only those where source or target is a touched file (modified, added, or
  removed). Previously the entire accumulated graph diff was emitted.
  Suppressed edge count is reported so nothing is silently hidden; `--json`
  still returns the full set.
- **Non-source nodes in outputs** — `high-blast` and `changed-since` now
  exclude `service`, `pipeline`, `database`, and `import` node types (Docker
  services, CI pipelines, npm packages) from all file and edge output.
- **FTS prefix search for natural-language queries** — `fts_search` now builds
  `word1* OR word2* OR ...` as the primary query so `auth login` also matches
  `authenticate`, `loginAction`, etc. Special FTS5 syntax characters are
  stripped before query construction to prevent `OperationalError`.
- **Graph expansion noise in search ranking** — `graph_expand` is now skipped
  when FTS (or semantic KNN) already returns ≥ k results, preventing
  structurally adjacent but semantically unrelated symbols from diluting
  high-quality keyword hits.
- **Search file aggregation** — `blastradius search` and the `semantic_search`
  MCP tool now include a `Files` section aggregating results by file (sorted
  by symbol hit count). The entry-point file appears even when no single
  symbol from it ranks at the top.
- **`db status` FTS row count** — `blastradius db status` now shows
  `fts_symbols` (rows in `symbols_fts`) making it easy to diagnose whether
  the FTS index is populated.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-06-07

### Fixed

- **Multi-word FTS search OR fallback** — `blastradius search "auth token"` previously
  returned nothing when AND semantics found no single symbol containing all words.
  `fts_search()` now retries with `word1 OR word2 OR ...` automatically when the
  AND query returns zero results.
- **`changed-since` backfill warning** — when `blastradius history` has never been run,
  all files share exactly one `first_seen_commit`, making `changed-since` results
  inaccurate against any older ref. The command now detects this via
  `COUNT(DISTINCT first_seen_commit) <= 1` and prints a clear warning on stderr
  (CLI) / includes a `"warning"` key in the response (JSON + MCP tool) directing
  the user to run `blastradius history` first.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-07

### Summary

blastradius evolves from a stateless point-in-time dependency analyzer into a
**temporal code knowledge graph** — persistent, incremental, and semantically
queryable. Three new properties: persistence + incrementality, time, and
meaning (semantic retrieval). All existing CLI commands, JSON schemas, and MCP
tools are unchanged.

### Added

#### Persistent SQLite store (Phase 1)
- `.blastradius/index.db` — SQLite graph store created automatically on
  `blastradius analyze`; survives across runs, never touches `blastradius.json`
- Incremental indexing: detects changed files via `git diff --name-status`
  between index runs; logs changed file count to stderr
- `blastradius db status` — schema version, last indexed commit, file/edge/symbol counts
- `blastradius db migrate` — applies pending schema migrations (runs automatically on open)
- `blastradius symbols` now syncs symbols to DB with FTS5 full-text index

#### Temporal layer (Phase 2)
- Every file, edge, and symbol carries `first_seen_commit` / `last_seen_commit`
  — facts are never hard-deleted, only soft-deleted with temporal stamps
- `blastradius history [--since REF] [--max-commits N]` — backfills temporal
  data from git history without any working-tree checkouts (uses
  `git ls-tree` + `git cat-file --batch`)
- `blastradius changed-since <ref>` — files and edges added or removed since a
  commit, branch, or tag
- `blastradius impact <file> --as-of <ref>` — blast radius at a historical point
  in time, not just HEAD

#### Semantic layer (Phase 3)
- `blastradius search "<query>" [--k N] [--as-of REF] [--json]` — hybrid
  semantic + FTS5 keyword + graph expansion search, fused with Reciprocal Rank
  Fusion (RRF)
- `blastradius/semantic/provider.py` — `EmbeddingProvider` ABC +
  `OpenAIEmbeddingProvider` HTTP client (stdlib `urllib` only, no new runtime deps)
- `sqlite-vec` optional extension for KNN vector search; absent = graceful
  fallback to FTS + graph with a clear notice (no crash, no config required)
- Embeddings generated automatically during `blastradius analyze` when
  `BLASTRADIUS_EMBEDDING_ENDPOINT` / `_MODEL` / `_DIMS` env vars are set
- `blastradius-cli[semantic]` extra: `uv tool install --force 'blastradius-cli[semantic]'`

#### MCP surface (Phase 4) — 4 new tools, existing 6 unchanged
- `semantic_search` — hybrid search from an MCP client; degrades gracefully
- `temporal_impact` — blast radius at a historical `as_of` ref
- `graph_query` — k-hop dependency neighborhood (`dependents` / `dependencies` / `both`)
- `changed_since` — files and edges added or removed since a ref

### Changed
- `schema_version` bumped to `"2"` with forward migration from `"1"`
- FTS5 `symbols_fts` rowid now equals `symbols.id` (enables direct FTS → symbol
  row mapping without a secondary lookup)
- `blastradius db status` output extended with `embedding_model`, `embedding_dims`,
  `vec_symbols` fields
- README rewritten to document all new commands, the SQLite store, semantic
  setup, and the full 10-tool MCP surface

### Internal
- `blastradius/store/db.py`: `Store` class — `init_vectors()`, `upsert_embeddings()`,
  `semantic_search()`, `fts_search()`, `graph_expand()`, `neighborhood()`,
  `symbol_visible_at()`, `get_symbol()`, `symbols_needing_embeddings()`
- `blastradius/temporal/history.py`: `backfill()` — BFS over git log via plumbing
  commands; no checkout side-effects
- `blastradius/semantic/search.py`: `hybrid_search()` with RRF fusion
- Dependency direction enforced: `store/` and `temporal/` never import from
  `semantic/` or `graph/`
- 7 new Phase 3 tests; 6 Phase 2 tests; 5 Phase 1 tests (18 total, all green)

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-24

### Added
- `blastradius lookup <symbol>` — find where a symbol is defined (file + line)
- `blastradius dependencies <file>` — show imports and imported-by for a file
- `blastradius high-blast` — list files above a blast score threshold
- All three new commands support `--json` for machine-readable output
- `lookup_symbol` and `build_symbol_index` tools in MCP server
- CLI integration test suite (`benchmark/test_cli.py`) — 37 assertions covering happy path, `--json` output, error cases, and sort-order invariants
- MCP server integration test suite (`benchmark/test_mcp.py`) — all 6 MCP tools tested via real JSON-RPC stdio

### Changed
- MCP tests made repo-agnostic via fixture discovery from live index files
- `--claude-md` symbol section wrapped in `symbolindex` code fence
